Extra Gunslinger Gear 2.0!

Ranger's Arsenal adds a variety of new ranged weapons, armors, and accessories. Additionally, it expands upon the hunter subclass (Ranger + Summoner) by adding more dedicated armor sets and accessories to the game.
...and yes, it does add infinite ammo items (but they are deliberately harder to get to provide balance). 

RECIPE MODS ARE RECOMMENDED WHILE THE WIKI IS BEING RECONSTRUCTED.

In the near future, I will be releasing Melee's Arsenal, Magic's Arsenal, and Summoner's Arsenal; all of which will have the same goal of adding quality of life items for each respective class.

More content is developed as I am willing & able.
Please inform me of any bugs.
